This session will describe how to centrally provide a pipeline product for Application team to deploy a serverless application. Similar pipeline products can be built for other deployment options such as container deployments.

The guide has four sections:

1.	Deploy IAM policies, roles and KMS keys
2.	Cloud Admin: Centrally vend deployment pipelines
3.	Developer: Deploy a sample serverless application using the provided pipelines
4.	Developer: Push sample code and check the pipeline activity


Let's look at the prerequisites before we proceed.
