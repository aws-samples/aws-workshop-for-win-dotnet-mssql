title: Prerequisites

For this workshop, we have provided a temporary AWS account that you will use to explore how you can use PowerShell to manage infrastructure in AWS. We have provisioned an Elastic Compute Cloud instance running Windows Server 2019 with the necessary tools installed as well as instances to use for testing. 

## Prerequisites: <a name="prerequisites"></a>
  - A 12-digit code (aka "hash") provided to you by the workshop instructor.
  
  - A laptop computer running Windows, OSX, or Linux

  - A Remote Desktop Services client.
    - If you are running Windows, you will already have one installed.
    - If you have a Mac, you may need to install a client. You can download the Microsoft Remote Desktop Services client by clicking
    [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466)
    (or navigate to
    <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466>).
    - If you are running a Linux distribution, you may need to install a client using your Linux distribution's package manager.

## Connecting to your team dashboard
Let's get started! Login to the team dashboard at the following URL:
    [https://dashboard.eventengine.run/login](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/login)

You will be prompted to enter a 12-character hash code for your team; this will be on the card provided to you at the beginning of the workshop.

Once you enter your hash code and click Proceed, you will be presented with your team dashboard. Click the "AWS Console" button to navigate to the credentials page for your account.

## Logging into the AWS Console
You will see a section entitled "login link" with a button labeled "Open Console." Click this button to open your account's console.

This will bring you to the AWS Console for your temporary account. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with this page; from here, you can navigate to one of the over 165 services AWS offers.

<div style="text-align:center;border:thin solid red;background-color:lightgray;color:black">
NOTE: For the purposes of this workshop, we have purposefully limited access to only the services needed. You may encounter error messages if you navigate to services other than those used for this workshop.

## Opening the CloudFormation dashboard
We are using the CloudFormation service to automatically provision the AWS resources that you will be using for this workshop. CloudFormation allows you to create documents known as `Templates` which describe the AWS resources you would like to provision, along with any configuration data for those resources. When you supply a template to CloudFormation, it will create a `Stack` that contains the resources. We will be using CloudFormation again later on in this workshop, but for now, let's examine the stack we created for you.

In the "Find Services" search bar, enter "CloudFormation" and click the link that appears below the search bar.

This will bring you to the CloudFormation dashboard.

## Viewing the outputs of our stack
At first, you will only see a single stack named "module-XXXXXXX" (Note: this is simply the name generated by our workshop's provisioning tool; you can provide the name for a stack when you create your own). To the right of the stack, you will see a tabbed details view. The tabs contain information regarding the stack, the events that occurred during the stack's lifecyle, the resources that were created by the stack, and any outputs that the stack returns. In our case, we're interested in the outputs, so click the `Outputs` tab.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/andyhopp-content/Conferences/2019/DotNetSouth/Outputs+tab.png)

You will note this tab contains three output parameters; we will be using these for this workshop:
* `VisualStudioInstancePassword` - The name of the Systems Manager Parameter that contains the administrator password for this instance
* `VisualStudioInstance` - The DNS name of the EC2 instance running Visual Studio 2019
* `BasicLambdaExecutionRoleArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role we created for your serverless application
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/andyhopp-content/Conferences/2019/DotNetSouth/CloudFormation+Outputs.png)

The first output parameter is the name of a Systems Manager parameter that contains the random password that was generated for our Visual Studio instance. Systems Manager is an AWS Service that allows you to manage, patch, and store configuration parameters for EC2 instances and other AWS resources. In this case, we're using the `Parameter Store` feature to store the generated password.

## View our Systems Manager parameter

<div style="text-align:center;border:thin solid red;background-color:lightgray;color:black">
NOTE: For the purposes of this workshop, we are storing the pasword as plaintext. This is NOT considered to be a best practice; in a production environment, you would either store this as an encrypted ("secure") string with restricted permissions for decryption, use an RSA keypair, or join the machine to an Active Directory domain.
</div>

Let's open the Systems Manager console to retrieve our password. Click the "Services" drop-down on the upper-left of your AWS Console. This will open a search pane. In the search box, enter "systems manager" and click the Systems Manager entry in the results. 
<div style="text-align:center;border:thin solid green">
Pro tip: we will be returning to the CloudFormation Outputs tab in a moment; if you hold the Control key (Windows) or the Command key (Mac), you will open Systems Manager in a new tab so we don't lose our place.
</div>

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/andyhopp-content/Conferences/2019/DotNetSouth/Search+for+Systems+Manager.png)

This will open the Systems Manager dashboard. In the left-hand pane, select "Parameter Store" to navigate to the parameters (you may need to scroll down).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/andyhopp-content/Conferences/2019/DotNetSouth/Select+Parameter+Store.png)

You should only see a single parameter in this list, with a name ending in "VisualStudioPassword". Click the parameter to view it, and copy the password to a temporary file for future reference.

## Connecting to our EC2 instance
Now it's time to connect to the EC2 instance. We have provisioned an EC2 instance running Windows Server 2019 for this workshop, and we have installed Visual Studio 2019 Community edition for you. Let's return to the CloudFormation Outputs tab for our stack by either returning to that browser tab or by searching for CloudFormation service from the Services drop-down and clicking the Outputs tab again. Copy the value for the `VisualStudioInstance` parameter; this is the DNS name for the EC2 instance. Use your Remote Desktop Services client (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above) to connect to this instance at this address. The username for the instance will be "Administrator" and the password will be the value copied from the Systems Manager parameter above.

Once you connect to your EC2 instance, you will see the machine's desktop.
