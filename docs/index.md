 Windows on AWS Workshops

Welcome to the AWS Windows workshops portal! Here you will find a collection of workshops and other hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem supporting Windows, SQL, and .Net workloads, and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to operating your Windows environments on AWS. 

The workshops and other hands-on content contained in this portal are prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The workshops will provide a deep dive into a variety of AWS services in support of running, operating, and modernizing Windows workloads on AWS. 

Regardless of the workloads you run on AWS, Security and Compliance is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" target="_blank">shared responsibility</a> between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the **Security of the Cloud**. AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the **Security in the Cloud**, is determined by which services the customer chooses to use.
