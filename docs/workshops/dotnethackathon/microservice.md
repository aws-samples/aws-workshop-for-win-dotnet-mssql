_Summary:_ 

Your team is part of a much larger team that is responsible for maintaining and updating a very large monolithic application that is a revenue generating application for the business. As the monolithic has grown it has become increasingly difficult to update the application and requires multiple teams to coordinate for even a small update. In an effort to become more agile and get features to the market faster it has been decided to break down the monolith and start building a micro-service architecture. Your team is the first team that will be converting their part of the application into a containerized micro-services.
