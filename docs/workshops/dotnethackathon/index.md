The idea of the .NET workshop is to inspire development teams to think outside the box, get hands-on with AWS services and .NET integration with the AWS platform. The event will start with a brief introduction of the event, challenges and logistics. The AWS team will offer a brief introduction of the services that will be leveraged in each challenge. The set of challenges have been designed to cover a variety of services and areas (architecture, messaging, databases, artificial intelligence). Participants are encourage to pick an area they are interested in and want to learn more about.
